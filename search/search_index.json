The \"platform\" part means a few things, for one EVA is a specification - a 3D printer can be EVA compatible (not the other way around - EVA is not to be compatible with a printer) thus automatically acquiring all the hardware compatibility EVA brings and will bring in it's future versions. New versions appear with compatibility for new hardware.

A good way to measure exactly is to assemble everything and put the PTFE cut to the calculated length into the hotend so it already goes through the top of the universal face and down the the heat break, then put your drive assembly on top and shave off any amount that is too long.
