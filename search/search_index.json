Please have patience with it and remember that you will likely need longer belts on your V-Core 3 for EVA 3.0 to work on it. EVA 2.4.2 If you are looking for the old version of EVA, it's here: https://2.eva-3d.page/ EH-v uh (/\u02c8\u025b.va/) - like in p E t, V ery, U p EVA is a 3D printing carriage platform revolving around accessibility - the goal is to give the power of choice to the users by enabling as many options for carriage hardware as possible. The \"platform\" part means a few things, for one EVA is a specification - a 3D printer can be EVA compatible (not the other way around - EVA is not to be compatible with a printer) thus automatically acquiring all the hardware compatibility EVA brings and will bring in it's future versions. New versions appear with compatibility for new hardware. Aside from being a spec, EVA also comes with a set of parts ready to use on compatible printers. EVA is developed by me - Pawe\u0142 Kucmus and the fantastic EVA and Rat Rig community. Getting started \u00b6 Navigate to the Getting Started page to learn where to start. If you know your way around this place already and just looking for a download link you will find it below. Either way please read further down to learn about the people behind EVA. Updates \u00b6 Best way to see what is new is to attend the live streams on YouTube . Support and attributions \u00b6 Rat Rig \u00b6 My and EVA's relationship with Rat Rig should not be a surprise as I'm also responsible for V-Core 3, V-Minion and V-Core Pro 1.2 and up. Rat Rig was and still is providing me with an amazing support in terms of hardware, guidance and emotional support All of their printers are EVA compatible. Other companies \u00b6 The nature of EVA is specific in a way that I always did shy away from any free parts producers were willing to send me. If I got something for free it was immediately sent to one of the beta testers. This is to prevent accusations towards the platform for being biased. There is no way of purchasing a spot here. That said if this will change and I'll start receiving parts it will not be a secret and I'll probably list those on one of the release lives on YouTube. People \u00b6 Mikkel Schmidt and Marc Marschall constantly pushed for more improvements, took some of the work of my shoulders - big thank you. Simon Davie is helping out for as long as I can remember, printer compatibility would not ba as good if not for Simon's checks. There's also a big group of people that helped out with beta testing, they had to go through a lot of work and plastic to test all the different iterations that I was producing when fixing more and more bugs - amazing bunch of people.

I'm working on it. V-Minion \u00b6 Almost there, sensorless homing should work, otherwise the X motor block on VM will need to be adjusted. I'm working on it. V-Core Pro >= 1.2 \u00b6 Not yet, but the port should be similar to VC3. V-Cast \u00b6 Not, depending on the demand and time I might port it but his will require some work. Parts explained \u00b6 Core \u00b6 Let's define the 4 main components as the Core, this would be: Top - interface between the MGN12 and the rest of EVA Front - universal interface for hotend mounts Bottom - support piece integrated with an cooling duct option Back - different backs are use for different motion systems Drive \u00b6 The component that goes on top of the top and front parts - specific to your chosen extruder option. Hotend \u00b6 Component wrapping the hotend around provided mounting for the hotend fan and interfaces with the front part. Cooling Inlet \u00b6 Component specific to your layer cooling fan option, attaches to the back . Cable Management \u00b6 Provides means to attach or organize cables routed to the carriage, attaches to the back . Bed Probe \u00b6 Goes on the front allows to mount the bed probe of your choosing. PTFE Lenghts \u00b6 You will need one piece of a PTFE tube going from the drive to the hotend. The length of that tube is different for each drive and hotend combo. To learn how much PTFE you need you can take a look at the BOM tables of you chosen drive and hotend and sum the two values ( do not cut into two pieces ). below is an example of the Nova hotend and LGX as the drive. Nova needs 39.65 mm to the \"roof\" of the universal front, LGX needs 20.8 mm which gives us 60.45 mm. Those are the measurements taken from CAD, in the real world there's usually a 0.2mm difference. A good way to measure exactly is to assemble everything and put the PTFE cut to the calculated length into the hotend so it already goes through the top of the universal face and down the the heat break, then put your drive assembly on top and shave off any amount that is too long. You don't have to be super precise there.","title":"Getting started"},{"location":"getting_started/#getting-started","text":"EVA might look intimidating at first but it's really not, sure the BOMs are complicated and you need to learn yourself around all this but think about it like this:","title":"Getting started"},{"location":"getting_started/#printer-compatibility","text":"Even thought EVA 3 is a major version jump from EVA 2 a lot a work was put to achieve as much backwards compatibility, below you'll find information about specific printer compatibility:","title":"Printer compatibility"},{"location":"getting_started/#v-core-3","text":"The X endstop block needs to change - get taller, also you will likely need longer belts if you cut them short - close to the carriage.
